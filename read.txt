Feb 22 10pm (i chnaged the ghost movemrent a bit )
-added random if statements within the handle all in events.c 

also didnt make their deltas 0 when the collide

some ghosts have different numbe rof if statements


add in a pick_direction() function that picks a direction for a ghost based on where they can move 
use if staments only as it can differ for each ghost (else ifs are also fine)

this is only called while they are in a valid position and have not collised as then they can just
take the next available path
